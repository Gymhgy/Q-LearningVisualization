# Q-LearningVisualization

A simulation for Q-Learning

# How to use

Just press run, and it the simulation will begin. You can set the delay to 0 to skip the simulation entirely and have the computation done instantly. Otherwise, the agent will attempt to take an action every [delay] seconds.

You can play around with the different variables. Note that learning rate and discount factor should be between 0-1. Only works on Windows.
